> **Upon completion of the commission you will pay first, then I will send the commissioned product.**

> **Your request must abide by the Roblox TOS as well as fit common sense. I will not make anything inappropriate for a Roblox Game.**

> **I request that credits are given via the description of the game or in game. This is not mandatory, however much appreciated. You must not credit someone else for my work.**

> **Feel free to ask for updates on the game if I don't send them. However, please do not rush me as I try to complete commissions ASAP.**

> **If you decide to cancel the commission, I will be partially compensated for the time and resources spent previously.**

> **Upon canceling, you will not receive a refund for your down payment with exception for special circumstances.**

> **Before Hiring me, you should have an idea of what you want made. I cannot read your mind nor deliver a satisfactory product if you cannot communicate clearly what you want made.**

> **Showing uncalled for behavior [eg. being unnecessarily rude] might demotivate me from continuing the commission so please refrain from doing so.**

> **If a product I have delivered to you randomly stops working due to something out of my control, I will try to take a look at it and fix it, however, It isn't my utmost priority and I'm not responsible for fixing it.**
